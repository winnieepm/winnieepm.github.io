i'm using 11ty to build a blog bc i'm also using it on another project, so i want to get more experience with it.

### 2025-04-15
i'd deleted a previous branch with the blog. it's tedious to get templates from Glitch, or idk how to do so properly.

ðŸš© idk why, but rn the styling on the 11ty subdir works fine when i run `npm start` but the page can't find `css/styles.css` if i access it from the parent site's main page.
