        <p>my craft is asking questions. this is a register of results, joys, and failures.</p>
<p>right now, i’m doing a cultural studies PhD in Spanish and working in the <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/">Scholars' Lab</a> at the University of Virginia. i’m also managing editor for archipelagos journal.</p>

         
            
            <section id="about" class="content-section"> 
                <h2>about</h2>
<p>the about will expand on the blurb, explain more about my current working position, research, and involvements. it'd be nice to add some personal background.</p>

            <section id="projects" class="content-section">
                <h2>projects</h2>
<p>there'll be a grid of tiles with project titles here. eventually, i'll turn them into cards with explanations, like figma thumbnails, each linking to a dedicated project personal record page, or the projects own page.</p>

<p>You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me and now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it! It's brilliant. So go ahead. If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead. Put a bullet, in my head, and kill me right now. DO IT! Do it. Do it. Do it.</p>
<p>Saul, Saul... this man that we spoke of before, this... this person that you said could... could disappear me, get me a whole new life and make sure that I'm never found. Yeah I need him, Saul. Gus is gonna murder my whole family. I need this man now. Saul... now, Saul!</p>
<p>Anything suspicious? Well... then should we go? Any uh... Cartel news these days? Seems like I'm always reading something or other in the paper. I don't want to talk about it. To you or anyone else. I'm done explaining myself. Gus is dead. We've got work to do.</p>

            <section id="blog" class="content-section">
                <h2>blog</h2>
<p>maybe a front-matter heavy file with a growing list of blog titles. the html shows a link per entry, all organized within a list.</p>

            </section>
            <section id="cv" class="content-section">
                <h2>cv</h2>
<p>the curriculum vitae section will use markdown, TEI, or the data mgmt feature in 11ty to dynamically generate a cv layout. there'll also be a button to download a pdf version of the cv.</p>
