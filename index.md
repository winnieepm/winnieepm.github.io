my craft is asking questions. this space registers results, joys, and failures.

right now, i’m doing a cultural studies PhD in Spanish and working in the <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/">Scholars' Lab</a> at the University of Virginia. i’m also managing editor for archipelagos journal.
