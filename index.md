my sport is asking questions and learning about everything. i document some results, joys, and failures here.

right now, i’m doing a PhD and working in the <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/">Scholars' Lab</a> at the University of Virginia. i’m also managing editor for archipelagos journal.
